_pkl-spring_ is a Spring Boot extension for configuring Boot apps with Pkl.

Because _pkl-spring_ plugs into Spring Boot's standard configuration mechanism,
configuring your Boot apps with Pkl works much the same as configuring them with Java properties or YAML.

Continue with {uri-installation}[installation] and {uri-usage}[usage instructions].
