= Spring Boot External Config Example
:uri-docs: https://pkl-lang.org/spring/current/spring-boot.html

This example demonstrates how to configure a Spring Boot application when the configuration files are placed _outside_ of the resources directory.

The link:src/main/resources/application.properties[resources/application.properties] file is a
typical Spring Boot config file importing link:config/application.pkl[config/application.pkl] from
external location.

Note the use of `amends "AppConfig.pkl"` in link:config/application.pkl[config/application.pkl]
which not only allows for the validation but also for the IDE code completion!

For a walkthrough, see the link:{uri-docs}[documentation].

To run the application, type `../gradlew run`.
To open the project in IntelliJ IDEA, go to File->Open and select the `samples` directory.
